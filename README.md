# Project Title : Credit Card Defaulter Prediction


Supervised Machine Learning Classification Problem

A brief description about the project: In this credit card defaulter prediction project i have used supervised machine learning and to solve this problem i've used CART as a technique. 

Problem Statement - Can we reliably able to predict who has is likely to default? If so, the bank may be able to prevent the loss by providing loan to other customers.

Data - German Credit Dataset

Target: Did the customer default? (Yes=1/Positive, No=0/Negative)

Features:

1. months loan duration - duration of the loan
2. credit history - previous record of the customer credit history
3. purpose - purpose of the loan taken
4. amount - amount of loan 
5. savings balance - what is the saved amount of the customer
6. employment duration - term of the employment 

Methodlogy

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Selection 
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Evaluation


reg_dt_model.score(X_train,train_labels) : 0.795714285714285

reg_dt_model.score(X_test,test_labels) : 0.7633333333333333
